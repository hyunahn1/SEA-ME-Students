## About me:
- Although I majored in History, I discovered a strong passion for systems programming. My ultimate goal is to develop operating systems for drones and automobiles. Through the SEA:ME program, I am eager to gain hands-on experience with RTOS, embedded systems, and autonomous driving technologies. While I am still improving my English, I am not afraid of making mistakes and will do my best to communicate and collaborate with everyone.
